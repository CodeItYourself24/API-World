<<<<<<<<<<<<<< API >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.

API >>
        Application -> day to day apps that you use
            Programming -> set of intructions that are used to perform a specific task
                Interface -> point where two apps/programs meet to interact with each other

    - helps in connecting various software components.

API terminologies >> (essential in making an api)

    - HTTP (get, put, post, delete)
    - URL
    - JSON
    - REST

REST >>

    REpresentational State transfer.

    - it is a stateless client server model (beneficial due to stateless nature).
    - used for web based architecture for data communication
    - uses HTTP to make calls btw machines

	The request sent by the client consists of all the data needed by a server to fulfill the request.

FEATURES >>
        - proper documentation and error messages


PRINCIPLES OF REST API >>

    - stateless, light weight, communication support
    - client server decoupling
    - uniform interface
    - cacheable
    - layered system
    - code on demand

METHODS OF REST API >>

    - create, read, update and delete (called CRUD operations)
    - which are POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE (HTTP methods)

What is a REST API?

    - it is an interface that allows applications to interact and share data. 
    - In a REST API, all data is treated as resources, each one represented by a unique uniform resource identifier (URI).


What do you mean by RESTful web services?

    REST API is also known as RESTful web services that follow the REST architecture.


What are cache-control headers?

    - Cache-control headers are used to control caching and to attain caching ability. The most commonly used cache-control headers are public, private, and No-Store.


What is the definition of messaging in terms of RESTful web services?

    - In REST API web services, when a REST client wants to send a message to the server, it can be sent in an HTTP request form, and the same applies to the server. This kind of communication is called messaging in REST.

            client -----message(HTTP request form)-------> server


Explain ‘Addressing’ in RESTful web services.

    - process of locating various types of resources with the help of a URL on the REST server is known as ‘addressing’ 
    - Usually, single or multiple resources are addressed by resources.
